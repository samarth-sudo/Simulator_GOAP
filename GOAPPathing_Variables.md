| closedStates        | List<GOAPWorldState>  | A list of states that have already been explored by the algorithm.                                 |
| requests            | List<GOAPPathRequest> | Holds the queued pathfinding requests awaiting processing.                                         |
| currentRequest      | GOAPPathRequest       | Tracks the pathfinding request currently being processed.                                          |
| drawGizmos          | bool                  | Toggle to enable or disable the visualization of states and paths in the Unity Editor.             |
| openNodesColour     | Color                 | Defines the color used to visualize open (unsearched) nodes in the Unity Editor.                   |
| closedNodesColour   | Color                 | Defines the color used to visualize closed (searched) nodes in the Unity Editor.                   |
| pathColour          | Color                 | Defines the color used to visualize the best path found by the algorithm.                          |
| totalPathsGenerated | int (readonly)        | Keeps a count of the total number of paths generated by the GOAPPathing system.                    |
| generationStartTime | float                 | Stores the time when the current pathfinding process started.                                      |
| generationLength    | float (readonly)      | Tracks the duration of the pathfinding process for the current request.                            |
