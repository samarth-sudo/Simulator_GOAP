# Simulator_GOAP

This repository hosts a Unity-based simulation project that demonstrates **Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP)** in action. The simulation allows users to experiment with different algorithms for decision-making and behavior planning within a dynamic environment.

---

## Features

- **GOAP-Based Simulation**: A pre-built simulator showcasing Goal-Oriented Action Planning for AI decision-making.
- **Algorithm Experimentation**: Easily swap between different algorithms to analyze their impact on the agent's behavior and performance.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Includes pre-built versions of the simulator for Apple Silicon and Intel-based systems.
- **Unity Integration**: Load the project as assets in Unity Hub and extend it for further customization.
